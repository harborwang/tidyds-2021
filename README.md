## Overview

This workshop provides a gentle introduction to data science using the R statistical programming language. In the first part of the workshop, you'll learn how to tidy, transform, and visualize data. We'll focus on best practices and methods that can be applied to wide range of data sets, using a suite of R packages known as the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org). Tidyverse packages, like [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org), [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org), and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) provide a grammar of data manipulation and visualization. In the second half of the workshop, we will focus on using data to make predictions with another suite of packages known as [tidymodels](https://tidymodels.org). Like the tidyverse, tidymodels packages, such as [parsnip](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org), [recipes](https://recipes.tidymodels.org), and [rsample](https://rsample.tidymodels.org) provide a grammar for modeling. Further, the tidymodels packages work seamlessly with the tidyverse packages. Throughout the workshop, students will learn how to combine text and R code in reproducible documents with [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

## Learning objectives

Students will learn to manage and visualize data and use model to make predictions from several common statistical models using the tidyverse and tidymodels suites of packages.

## Is this course for me?

This workshop is appropriate for attendees who answer yes to the questions below:

- Are you new and R and want to learn how to explore, visualize, and model data?

- Are you familiar with R, but want to learn how the tidyverse and tidymodels can take you to the next level?

If you answered yes to either question, you are in the right place! If you are already familiar with the tidyverse and/or tidymodels and want more than an introduction, this course might not be for you.

## Prework

The course will be taught over Zoom, so make sure you have stable internet connection. Please make sure you have computer or laptop that has the following installed:

  - A recent version of R (\>=4.0.0), which is available for free at
    cran.r-project.org

  - A recent version of RStudio Desktop (\>=1.4), available for
    free at www.rstudio.com/download (RStudio Desktop Open Source
    License)

  - The R packages we will use, which you can install by connecting to
    the internet, opening RStudio, and running at the command line:
    
        install.packages(c("tidyverse", "tidymodels", "fivethirtyeight",
                           "ggthemes", "babynames", "nycflights13", "skimr",
                           "AmesHousing", "rpart", "ranger", "kknn",
                           "palmerpenguins", "vip", "themis", "modeldata",
                           "parallel", "doParallel", "reprex"),
                         dependencies = TRUE)
        
And donâ€™t forget your power cord\!
