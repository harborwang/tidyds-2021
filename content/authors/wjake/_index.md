Jake Thompson is a senior psychometrician at [Accessible Teaching, Learning, and Assessment Systems](http://atlas.ku.edu/) at the University of Kansas where he works on the [Dynamic Learning Maps](http://dynamiclearningmaps.org/) alternate assessment and the [Innovations in Science Map, Assessment & Report Technologies](https://ismart.works) project. He completed my PhD in Educational Psychology & Research at the University of Kansas with an emphasis in [Research, Evaluation, Measurement, and Statistics](http://epsy.ku.edu/academics/educational-psychology-research/phd/overview-benefits). His research interests are in the areas of R programming and psychometrics, specifically the application of diagnostic classification models to educational assessment.

Jake loves the Chiefs, Cubs, and above all else, KU basketball. He currently lives in Kansas City, Kansas, with his wife and their rescue dog [Larry](https://www.instagram.com/lyfewithlarry/?hl=en).
