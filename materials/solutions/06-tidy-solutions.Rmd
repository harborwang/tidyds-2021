## Tidy and untidy data

`table1` is tidy:

```{r}
table1 
```

`table2` isn't tidy, the count column really contains two variables:

```{r}
table2
```


## Your Turn 1

Is `bp_systolic` tidy?

```{r}
bp_systolic
```


## Your Turn 2

Using `bp_systolic2` with `group_by()`, and `summarize()`:

* Find the average systolic blood pressure for each subject
* Find the last time each subject was measured

```{r}
bp_systolic2 %>% 
  group_by(subject_id) %>%
  summarize(avg_sys = mean(systolic),
            last_measurement = max(time))
```


## Your Turn 3

On a sheet of paper, draw how the `cases` data set would look if it had the same values grouped into three columns: **country**, **year**, **n**

country     | year |  cases |
----------- | ---- |  ----- |
FR          | 2011 |   7000 |
DE          | 2011 |   5800 |
US          | 2011 |  15000 |
FR          | 2012 |   6900 |
DE          | 2012 |   6000 |
US          | 2012 |  14000 |
FR          | 2013 |   7000 |
DE          | 2013 |   6200 |
US          | 2013 |  13000 |


## Your Turn 4

Use `pivot_longer()` to reorganize `table4a` into three columns: **country**, **year**, and **cases**.

```{r}
table4a %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -country, names_to = "year", values_to = "n",
               names_transform = list(year = as.integer))
```


## Your Turn 5

On a sheet of paper, draw how `pollution` would look if it had the same values grouped into three columns: **city**, **large**, **small**

city     | large | small |
-------- | ----- | ----- |
New York |    23 |    14 |
London   |    22 |    16 |
Beijing  |   121 |    56 |


## Your Turn 6

Use `pivot_wider()` to reorganize `table2` into four columns: **country**, **year**, **cases**, and **population**.

```{r}
table2 %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "type", values_from = "count")
```


## separate() and unite()

```{r}
scores %>%
  separate(name, into = c("first", "last"), sep = " ")
```

```{r}
sep_scores <- scores %>%
  separate(name, into = c("first", "last"), sep = " ")
sep_scores %>%
  unite("full_name", first, last, sep = " ")
```

# Take Aways

Data comes in many formats but R prefers just one: _tidy data_.

A data set is tidy if and only if:

1. Every variable is in its own column
2. Every observation is in its own row
3. Every value is in its own cell (which follows from the above)

What is a variable and an observation may depend on your immediate goal.
